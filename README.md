Generates and maintains multiple lockfiles so that you can test your elixir app
against different variations of your dependencies

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `blend` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:blend, "~> 0.1.3"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

### 1. Initialization

```
$ mix blend.init
```

### 2. Define your blends

Edit and set your blends in the auto-generated `blend.exs` file.


### 3. Resolve blends and generate lockfiles

```
$ mix blend.get
```

to resolve your blends and generate new lockfiles with variations of your dependencies under the new `/blend` folder.

### 4. Ignore blend build artifacts

Add

```
# .gitignore

/blend/_build
/blend/deps
```

to your `.gitignore` file.

before comitting your changes.


### 5. Running in the context of a blend lockfile

#### Option A. Overriding your `mix.lock`.

If you just need a CI job step to run against a blend lockfile, it might be enough to just:

```
$ mv blend/<blend-name>.mix.lock mix.lock
```

as a CI step before `mix deps.get`.

#### Option B. `BLEND` env var configuration

A more permanent configuration for running mix tasks in the context of a blend lockfile with a simple env var
can be acomplished by customizing your `mix.exs` a bit, with the following steps.

##### 1. Create a new file `blend/premix.exs` with the following contents:

```elixir
# blend/premix.exs

maybe_put_env = fn varname, value ->
  System.put_env(varname, System.get_env(varname, value))
end

blend = System.get_env("BLEND")

if blend && String.length(blend) > 0 do
  maybe_put_env.("MIX_LOCKFILE", "blend/#{blend}.mix.lock")
  maybe_put_env.("MIX_DEPS_PATH", "blend/deps/#{blend}")
  maybe_put_env.("MIX_BUILD_ROOT", "blend/_build/#{blend}")
end
```

##### 2. Add `Code.compile_file("blend/premix.exs")` statement to the top of your `mix.exs`.

##### 3. Conditionally set the `lockfile` option in your `mix.exs`'s `def project`.

Something like this would be enough:

```elixir
# In mix.exs

  def project do
    [
      ...
    ]
    |> Keyword.merge(maybe_lockfile_option())
  end

  defp maybe_lockfile_option do
    case System.get_env("MIX_LOCKFILE") do
      nil -> []
      "" -> []
      lockfile -> [lockfile: lockfile]
    end
  end
```

##### 4. Enjoy

Now you can run any task, e.g. run your tests, against different lockfiles locally by just executing:

```
$ BLEND=<blend-name> mix test
```

### 6. Updating blend lockfiles

```
$ mix blend.update --all
```

whenever you want to update all your blend lockfiles to latest possible versions.
